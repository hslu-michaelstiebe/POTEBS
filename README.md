# POTEBS - Investigating the Potential of E-Bike-Sharing Systems for Sustainable Mobility in Different Spatial Types ðŸš²

Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) - Funded Research Project 
SFOE Grant No.: SI/502720-01
Duration: Dec 2023 to Jan 2028
Partners: University of Basel, Pick-e-Bike AG, PubliBike AG

Short Description: 
The POTEBS project seeks to investigate the potential of EBSS in different spatial types - urban, peri-urban, and rural - within the Basel metropolitan area. By analyzing the user characteristics and behavior patterns of both free-floating and station-based e-bike systems, this project aims to provide critical insights into how these systems can be better integrated into multimodal transport networks.
